Calling from one sub to another:

Stackoverflow:

	Private Sub MainMacro()
    Dim lReturn As Long

    'Get the return from the CommentSub
    lReturn = CommentSub

    'Pass that to the nextsub
    NumberOfRowsToCopy (lReturn)
End Sub

Function CommentSub() As Long 'Declare the return type after the function
  Dim NewOrderLineCounter As Long
  Dim Counter As Integer
  For Counter = 1 To 500
    If Cells(Counter, "S") = "New" Then
      NewOrderLineCounter = NewOrderLineCounter + 1
      Cells(Counter, "V").Select
      ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "New Line"
    End If
  Next Counter

  'Here you set the return value of the funtion
  CommentSub = NewOrderLineCounter
End Function

Sub NumberOfRowsToCopy(lCount As Long) 'Declare the variable being passed to the sub.
Dim NewOrderLineCounter As Long
NewOrderLineCounter = lCount
  ActiveSheet.Range("$A$12:$T$1001").AutoFilter Field:=16, Criteria1:= _
    "New"
  ActiveSheet.Range("B15:N" & NewOrderLineCounter).SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible).Select
End Sub
Or if you want to go with the public variable route, declare them at the top of the form or module code. Above all functions and subs.

'Declared like this it can be accessed by any sub or function in this module or form.
Private NewOrderLineCounter as Long

'Declared like this it can be accessed by any sub or function in this module or form and from others. Although I think if it is in a form it will not be accessible from modules.  For that you can create a module called globals and declare it there as public.
Public NewOrderLineCounter as Long

Sub MainMacro ()
  Call CommentSub
  Call NumberOfRowsToCopy
End sub

Sub CommentSub
  Dim Counter As Integer
  For Counter = 1 to 500
    If Cells(Counter, "S") = "New" Then
      NewOrderLineCounter = NewOrderLineCounter + 1
      Cells(Counter, "V").Select
      ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "New Line"
    End If
  Next Counter
End sub

Sub NumberOfRowsToCopy
  ActiveSheet.Range("$A$12:$T$1001").AutoFilter Field:=16, Criteria1:= _
    "New"
  ActiveSheet.Range("B15:N" & NewOrderLineCounter).SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible).Select
End sub






Another option is to pass the variable to the second code:

Sub FirstCode()

lstRow = Range("A65536").End(xlUp).Row

SecondCode(lstRow)

End Sub

==========================================

Sub SecondCode(ByVal RowCnt as Double)

MsgBox RowCnt

End Sub
